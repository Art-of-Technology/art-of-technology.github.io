# Overview

PayBin's goal is to provide you a set of simple, beautiful and powerful APIs. At PayBin everyone works hard to make it as easy as possible for developers to integrate fast, low cost global payments and banking into any digital product or service. We strongly believe that solid, programmatic abstractions like ours will help companies achieve competitive differentiation through better user experience, lower costs and by unlocking the growth potential of cross border commerce.

PayBin provides a fully automated solution for accepting cryptocurrencies as an alternative payment method. Our software is suitable for every business, from basic websites to enterprise-level systems.

The API allows you to accept cryptocurrency payments from customers, regardless of how much they pay. With just a few short lines of code, your goods will be paid for in the hundreds of supported cryptocurrencies.
